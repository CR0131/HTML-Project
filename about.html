              <h3>Who Am I, and What am I currently Doing?</h3>
              <p>My name is Christian Reynolds and I am a college student pursuing a career in programming.
              I began pursuing programming in highschool, and decided in my senior year that I wanted to pursue this
              as a career. So far I have learned programming languages like Python, C++, Java, Visual Basic, and HTML/CSS.
              I plan to lean other languages such as Swift, and JavaScript.</p>

              <h3>What are my Biggest Achievements?</h3>
              <p>Although this may not relate with my career of choice, I do have a few achievments that I am proud of.
              The first is that I had the honor to participate in Sullivan County All County Music not just once, but twice.
              The second is that I played TAPS in our local government center for a veteran service.
